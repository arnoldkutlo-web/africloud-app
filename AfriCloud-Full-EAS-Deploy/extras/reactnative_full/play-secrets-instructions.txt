Google Play Store submission requires a Service Account JSON key with 'Release Manager' permissions.

- Create service account in Google Play Console (or Google Cloud) and grant access.
- Download JSON key and store it in GitHub Actions as secret 'GOOGLE_PLAY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT' (base64 or raw JSON).
- Alternatively add the JSON to the repository via encrypted secrets or use EAS submit's service account path.
