React Native mobile app scaffold

This is a high-level scaffold for a React Native app:
- Expo-managed or bare React Native project
- Use RN FS to upload files and fetch download URLs
- Use the same backend auth endpoints and api service

I can generate a full RN project scaffold on request (Android APK / iOS build instructions).
